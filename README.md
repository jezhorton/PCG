# Procedural Content Generation
These are the scripts I used in my space diorama that generates moving settlements.
In these scripts the Perlin noise functionaility has be utilised for generating planets, these can be created dynamically on runtime or can be created by using a premade 'working' algorithm.



To create the moving settlements utlisiing the random function was the best approach, each interation of the buildings and settlement then generate the children of the object, this is done randomly and in specific locations and dimensions depending on the object.
